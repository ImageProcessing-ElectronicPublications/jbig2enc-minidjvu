| [test 01](test01) | This material was discovered while trying to transcode DjVu to PDF in 2023. This material revealed a lot of errors of the leptonica classifier in the headings and highlighted inscriptions. This material became the basis for the recipe developed and documented here. Due to the fact that the source is DjVu with classification already applied, only classification errors can be tested on this material, but not the compression level. |
| [test 02](test02) | This material was taken randomly in 2024 to test not only classification errors, but also the degree of compression. |
